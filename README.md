# Space Rover

This repository captures activities related to the development of a space rover.

The space rover project includes a drone that is used to survey the area.

## Hardware

This hardware list is being generated ad-hoc and will definitely not include every cable, connector, etc.

- 2x Raspberry Pi zero w.
- STM32H.
- STM32N.
- STM32F.
- STLINK V2.
- YP-05 Serial board.

## Development Plan

This section contains the plan for development of the system.

### Design Phase

This phase intends to capture the concept of operations and any requirements on the proposed system. Why create it? What problems does it solve? What environment does it operate in?

### Minimum Working Phase

This phase intends to capture the minimum required functionality to serve the purpose of it's creation (the systems purpose, not the projects purpose; which is to learn).

### Additional Functionality Phase

This phase intends to capture additional functionality that would significantly increase the utility or entertainment value of the system.

### Pre-release Phase

This phase intends to capture the necessary steps prior to release of the system as a project or product.

### Post-release Phase

This phase intends to capture the necessary steps after release to maintain and improve the system.
